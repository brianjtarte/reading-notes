# Day 3 - Passing Functions as Props

## .MAP() and Keys

1. What does .map() return?
It returns a new array using an already existing array.
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

You would use an arrow function contained inside of curly braces, which would allow you to utilize JSX.

3. Each list item needs a unique **KEY**
4. What is the purpose of a key?
Keys provide unique identifiers so react can track which items have changed or been added/removed. Ideally, they're given to the elements inside of an array which will give them a stable id.

## Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator? It is an elipsis that is used to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments, according to medium.com

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Copy an array
- Combine objects
- Add item to a list
- Add a state in react

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

``` 
const arrayOriginal = [1,2,3]
const arrayNew = [4,5,]

const combinedArr = [...arrayOriginal, ...arrayNew]


```


4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```
const arrayOriginal = [1,2,3]
const arrayNew = [4,5, ...arrayOriginal]

```

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
 ```
 const arrOne = {hello}
 const arrTwo = {world}

 const arrThree = {...arrOne, ...arrTwo}
 ```

*In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?* 

The dev creates a function within the state to serve as the foundation for passing between components.

*In your own words, what does the increment function do?*

It takes in the array 'people', finds a match to the name and increments the count by one.

*How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?*

Just like you would any other object, using props.

*How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?*

You call it where you want to invoke it.
