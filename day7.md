# Day 7 Reading Notes

## Functions

- "Small bit of code that gives specific instructions." - *Amanda, 2021 CE*

- You make a function by starting with the word 'function', followed by a parameter in parenthesis.
   
- Should be repeatable and have an expected result.

- Should be able to read function name and know what the function is doing.

**Functions can be called on multiple times in a document, and can always access global variables, however, variables designated within a function cannot be accessed outside of that.**
