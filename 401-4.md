# Reading Day 4

## Classed and Objects

- Object
  - [An encapsulation of vairables and functions into a single entity](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

- Class
  - Used to create objects; think "template"

Example:

```
  class SomeClass:
    var = someVar

    def function(self):
      print("Hello World from inside the class.")

  newObject = MyCLass()
```

- In the above example, we have created a class called `SomeClass`, and then assigned the class to an object called `newObject`

To access an object variable, we use dot notation:

- `newObject.var` would allow us to access `var` in the class above

- Classes can contain multiple objects of that same class that have the same variables and functions defined.
  - Each object essentially maintains its own copy of the class variables, so each new object can assign a new value to the variable without impacting the others

## Thinking Recursively

- Recursive functions call themselves, repeating their behavior until whatever defined condition is met to return a result
