# Day 16 - Serverless

## What is Serverless?

["Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure." - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)

### Pros:
1. Developer productivity -  allows devs to focus on code and not having to manage infrastructure to support it
2. Cost - With a serverless platform, you pay for execution. It's kinda like a taxi cab insofar that there is a meter that starts when a request is made and ends when execution completes
3. Language - You can develop in any language with serverless
4. Streamlined - Simplifies deployment
5. Usage Visibility - Serverless provides an unparalleled view into system and user times

### Cons:
1. Latency - Because Serverless scales back to zero, it is not suitable for all applications that might be negatively impacted by starting from zero to initiate a new request.
2. Cost - Serverless is great for applications whose workload spikes from time to time, more predictable applications may not realize the same benefit.
3. Monitoring/Debugging - Proves to be more difficult than a traditional server application using existing tools and processes
4. Migrating - Because each cloud provider may/is likely to have different infrastructure than one another, migrating code can be painful. At times, code may require partial or complete rewriting to move to a new platform
