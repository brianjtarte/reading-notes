# Day 12 Notes

## Chart.js

- Charts are a more visually appealing for displaying tables. 
- They're much better to use than tables and actually convey the data more quickly. 
- The downside is that they're more difficult to create.

## ```<canvas>```

- Can be styled like any normal ```<img>``` element, specifying things like margin, border, or background. 

However, unlike the ```<img>``` tag, ```<canvas>``` requires a closing ```</canvas>``` tag as well.
