# Reading ***THREE***

## Lists 

 There are *3* primary types of lists: 
 1. Numbered Lists or 'ordered list ', which consists of using the list tag `<ol>`, then each list item `<li>` will be nested within that list tag. The end result is a numbered list. 
- Bulleted Lists similar to ordered, however, the primary tag is `<ul>`, and the subsequent `<li>` tags will be preceded by bullet points.
- Definition Lists - this is the only one that does not use the previously mentioned elements. They're used for what they sound like: definitions! They use 3 distinct elements 
 - `<dl>` the primary element that defines it as a definition list 
   - `<dt>` this element contains the term being defined AND 
     - `<dd>` this element contains the actual definition 

Each type has it's own purpose, and I would argue that it is up to the end-user to determine the style of list you will use in your code. 

## Boxes 

Part of the CSS world, boxes allow you style your webpage in way that is more aesthetically pleasing and help improve the flow of the page.

You can set the dimensions of boxes, create various borders, set the margins in boxes (space on the *outside* of the box), as well as the padding (space *between* the box border and the content within), and show/hide boxes.

You can also style boxes with the `box-shadow` property, which creates a drop shadow around the box, or you can even remove those harsh corners of your border by rounding them over with the `border-radius` property.

## Basic Javascript Instructions

### ***Arrays***:

- Are a special type of variable that store a *list* of values.

- Just like setting a variable, for example, when creating an array of colors, you might write:
  `let colors = ['white','black','red'];`

- Within an array, each item is given a number calle an **index** that will be used to access specific items in the array. It should be noted that index values all start at 0.
  - For our list above white would be 0, black would be 1, and red would be assigned 2,
  - Accessing these indexes is as simple as specifying the array name, followed by the index number in square brackets: `colors[1]`

### ***IF...Else Statements***

 - These statements are meant to evaluate a condition to true, and if that condition does not exist, evaluate the condition as false.

 ### ***Switch Statements***

 - Typically perform faster than the aforemented statements, and are contained all in one code block. They start with the variable called the **switch value**:
  `switch(value){}`

Within the code block will be multiple levels or cases as they are formally known:

```
switch(value){
  case a:
  //code;
  break; 

  case b:
  //code;
  break;

  case c:
  //code;
  break/

}
```

Following the case will be the code block, and then `break;` which tells the JS that it has finished the switch statement and to move onto the next.

### Truthy/Falsy ###

Every value in JS is treated as if it is true or false.

Falsy values are treated as if they are false and can simply be treated as the number 0.

Conversely, truthy values are treated as if they are true and can be treated as the number 1.

Falsy values are: the boolean false, the number zero, an empty string, NaN, and a variable with no assigned value.

Truthy values are: basically everything else: boolean true, numbers other than zero, strings with content, number calculations.

### Loops ###

While there are three common types of loops: For, While, and Do While, For and While tend to be the ones actually used the most.

1. declare the variable 
2. set the condition 
3. set what happens to the variable after each iteration

```
for(1; 2; 3;){run until 2 is no longer true}
```

**For Loops**:
- Used when you know how many times you want the loop to run
- Primarily use for arrays 
- Used when conditions for a set of data can change

**While Loops**:
- It is similar in nature to an if statement, but runs until the defined condition is no longer true.
- Used when you have a known/specific condition.
