## Random Module

### When should it be used?
- *"We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website."* - [Python For Beginners](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)

### Random Functions

 - `Randint` this function will give us a random integer and it accepts two paramenters: a lowest and a highest number
  
 ```
    print random.randint(1, 10)
```
- The above method will give us a random number between 1 and 10
- `random` can also be multiplied in the event we want a larger number
- `choice` this function can be used to choose a random element from a list
- `shuffle` will take in a list and output a shuffled list so the elements are in a random order
- `randrange` will generate a randomly selected element from range(start,stop,step)

### Risk Analysis

 - It is identifying the risks in software we build and then prioritizing those risks to test
 - Used to highlight the potential problem areas 
 - Different types of risks included:
   - Business Risks: risk that may come from company or customer
   - Testing Risk: You need to be proficient in the platform you're working on as well as the testing tools being used
   - Premature Release Risk: Analyzing the risk associated with releasing untested software
   - Software Risk: Be cognizant of the risks associated with the development process

### Test Coverage

- Is a useful tool for finding untested parts of your codebase
- Targeting a certain level of coverage can lead to low quality testing because developers are aiming for the target vs trying to find untested code
