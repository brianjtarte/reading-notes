## Pair Programming

The 6 reasons for pair programming are:
1. Better efficiency
1. Engaging collaboration because two programmers have to work together/interact to achieve their goal
1. Learning from fellow students/colleagues. Everyone has their own skillsets and are stronger than others in some areas. Pair programming allows us to take advantage of these skillsets and teach each other something.
