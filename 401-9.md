## Dunder Methods:
- They're pre-defined methods such as `__init__` or `__str__`
- They let you emulate the behavior of built-in types [dbader](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)
- Always need a constructor `__init__` which allows you to create objects from a given class
- There are myriad dunder methods that can be found at [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)

## Probability in Python
- Sample space: set of all possible events that can happen
- In order to calculate probability, we need to establish the sample space and then divide the number of times an event can occur by the sample space
- Your error rate tends to shrink as the sample size increases. A way to look at it is that statistical outliers tend to be less impactful in a set of data if you increase the number of trials
