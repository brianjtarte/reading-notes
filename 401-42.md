# Reading Notes Day 42 - Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods
- What are dunder methods?
  - Special methods used to enhance your python classes
  - Sometimes called 'magic methods'
- Most common for us to use is `__init__`
- For more about the dunder methods, visit [Dbader](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

## Iterators
- Provide pythonic sequences interfaces to Python objects
- Must utilize `__iter__` and `__next__` for an object to support iteration

For more on iteration, take a look at [Dbader](https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators)

## Generators
- Help simplify code for writing objects that support the iterator protocol
- `yield` will temporarily stop the execution of a generator and provide the values back from it

***These built-in methods are all incredibly useful for writing clean and efficient code***
