# Code 201 Day 1 Reading Notes

## **Refresher**

Today was really just a *refresher* of 102, getting us back into the swing of things.

A couple of things we discussed that we didn't really focus too much on in 102 were:

1. ***Inline*** style tags

      and

2. ***Inline*** script

While we covered those topics in 102, we primarily focused on creating external sheets to link.

### ***Reading Notes Day 1***

1. Extra Markup
  - One of the new things I learned was the iframe feature that allows you to display an external webpage within another active page. This is something you might see on a webpage that discusses directions to a business; they would show the google maps page on the screen.
