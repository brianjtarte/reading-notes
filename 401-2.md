# Testing and Modules

## TDD - Test Driven Development

- TDD is a test first strategy
- Their purpose is to exercise input, outpout, and behavior
- Your test file name should follow the same convention as your module:
  - `module.py` --> `test_module.py`

### AAA Convention:
- Arrange: *organize the data needed to execute the code (input)*
- Act: *Execute the code (exercise behavior)*
- Assert: *Check if result is what was expected*

### The Cycle:
- There are 3 steps!
1. Write a unit test and make it ***FAIL***
1. Write the feature and make the test ***PASS***
1. Refactor the code - remember your first go doesn't have to be pretty, it needs to be ***GOOD ENOUGH***

##  If Name Equals Main
```
if__name__=="__main__":
```
- Necessary to execute code only if file was run directly and not imported

## things I want to know more about:
- if name equals main. Have a general idea, but don't fully grasp the necessity.
- Recursion. Watched the video, read the article...does not compute.
