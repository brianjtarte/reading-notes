## Reading 43 part 2 - Open Source Contribution

- What I've learned so far with this reading is that open source contribution isn't all that difficult, assuming you know what you're doing! However, contributing to open source projects is key to the life of a developer, especially one looking to improve their craft, and/or obtain a job in the industry. I really appreciated the resources the readings provided. Some of my favorites are:
- [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/get-involved-in-open-source-today-how-to-contribute-a-patch-to-a-github-hosted-open-source-project-like-code-52)
- It's a blog that is basically a walk through on how to contribute to open source projects
- [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
- This one curates issues from myriad open source projects to make your first contribution "easy"
