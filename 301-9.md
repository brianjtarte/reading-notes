## Functional Programming

1. What is functional programming?

- "Is a declarative programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

2. What is a pure function and how do we know it's pure?

- It's a function that returns the same result given the same arguments. It can also be referred to as "deterministic"
- It doesn't cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

- For starters, it is much easier to test and it doesn't require us to mock anything

4. What is immutability?

 - It is data whose state cannot change after it is created

5. What is referential transparency?

- When functions return the same result for the same input, they are considered referentially transparent

- So, pure functions combined with immutable data result in referential transparency

## Modules

1. What is a module?

- It is another file in the tree that contains related code

2. What does the word 'require' do?

- Require is to the backend what import is to the front end

3. How do we bring in a module to the file we are working on?

- `const module = require('./module.js')`

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

- You have to export it and require it
