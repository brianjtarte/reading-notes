### HTML Links 

- Creating HTML Links is done by using hte `<a>`/`</a>` tags.
  Everything inside of the tags becomes the hyperlink.
    - Within the first tag, you would indicate `href` for 'hyper reference' `=` then the URL to your link OR the `mailto:` link that starts up the users email program to send an email to a specific place:

      - Examples:

      - Link to a website
    `<a href = "https://www.somewebsite.com>TEXT TO DISPLAY</a>`

      - Email link:

    `<a href="mailto:joeschmoe@gmail.com>EMAIL JOE</a>`
