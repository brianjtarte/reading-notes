# Reading 17 - Web Scraping

## What is Web Scraping?

- Web scraping is a technique that can be used to extract large amounts of data from various websites

### Inspecting Websites
- The user must understand basic `html tags` in order to effectively scrape a website
- You'll need to right click on the website and 'inspect', which will give you access to the console
- Click the arrow symbol left of 'elements' in the console. Doing so highlights the code for a particular item, which can be used to find the source `.txt` file

### Using Python to Scrape

1. Import the following:
    ```
    import requests
    import urllib.request
    import time
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    ```
2. You'll set the url (potatoes) to the website, and then access with the requests library
3. You then parse the `html` with BeautifulSoup and use the `.findAll` method to locate all of the `<a>` tags.
4. One thing to keep in mind is to ensure you use the `time.sleep()` method so the code is paused momentarily and doesn't spam the website with requests

### Beautiful Soup

- Is a python library that makes web scraping easier and will parse anything you throw at it. It can even take invalid markup and turn it into a parse tree.
