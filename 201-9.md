## Forms and Events

### Forms

Are HTML elements used to collect information from users. 

You can use forms to:
- Add text through a single line *text input*, *password input*, or multi-line *text area*
- Have the user make a choice through: *radio buttons*, *checkboxes*, or *drop-down boxes*
- Finally, you can submit the forms in various ways through: *submit buttons*, *image buttons*
- You can also upload files through a *file upload*

Structure of a `<form>` element

All form controls live in the aforementioned element. Every form element requires an `action` attribute that holds a value of the URL for the page that the server will receive the information on.

  - Forms can be sent using either the `"get"` method or the `"post"` method. The get method is ideal for short forms or if you're just retrieving data from the web server. The post method should be used when you have a large form, it contains sensitive data, or allows you to upload a file.

Within the form element, we need to identify the type of `<input>`. You can identify the `type = " "` using the previously mentioned form types (password, text, etc.). You also need to provide a `name` attribute as well.code  

An example of a text input used in Duckett's *HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites* book:
```
  <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php'>
    <p>Username:
      <input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30">
    </p>
  </form>
```
### Events

Events occur when the user does something on the website, such as click a link, hover over an element, etc. There are UI events, keyboard events, mouse events, focus events, form events, and mutation events.

There are 3 ways to bind an event to an HTML element:
- HTML Event Handlers (not recommended)
- Traditional DOM event handlers
- DOM level 2 event listeners
