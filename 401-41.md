## Dynamic Routes
- Creating a dynamic route is as "simple" as adding brackets to a route, thereby making it dynamic
- Allows for use of url slugs, pretty urls, etc.
  - Can catch all routes with the use of `...`
  - Can be made optional catch all by putting param in double brackets `[[...someparam]]`
- Note, predefined routes will always take priority over dynamic routes
