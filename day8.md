# Day 8 Notes

## Loops

- There are ***TWO*** types of loops:
    1. For
    2. While

### For Loops
1. Declare the variable
2. Set the condition
3. Set what happens to the variable after each iteration

for(1;2;3){
    //run until 2 is no longer true
}

 - Used when you know how many times you want the loop to run.

 - Will be used primarily for arrays (sets of data).

 - For sets of data where condition could change.
### While Loops

- A loop that is similar in nature to an if statement, but runs until the defined condition is no longer true.

- When you have a known/specific condition
