# Reading 12 - Data Science w/Pandas

## Pandas

- Pandas is a Python library that can be used for data manipulation and/or analysis
- It's a quite powerful tool that can take in various datasets, such as CSV files and allow the developer to utilize the data for analysis
- Great tool for Data Science
- Some examples of methods within Pandas:
  - `.mode()` allows the user to find the mode of a dataset, or find the value that occurs the most
  - `.mean()` allows the user to find the mean of a dataset (average)
  - `.median()` allows the user to find the median or middle value of a dataset
- Pandas is great for manipulating "big data" - while Excel can do the same functions, Pandas allows the user to manipulate larger datasets that would be extremely difficult to work through in Excel
