# Reading Notes Day 6

## Object Literals, Document Object Model (DOM), & Problem Domain

### Object Literals

- They group together variables and functions. When used in an object, variables become "properties" and functions  become "methods".
- Properties and methods also have names/values, and those are called a **key**.
- Objects cannot contain two keys with the same name.
- A property can hold a value of a string, number, another object,  boolean, or an array; the method is always a function.
- Accessing a property is done by writing the name of the object, followed by a dot, then the name of the property
- To access/use the method, it follows the same principle, however after the dot, you would write the method name

***Example*** from Jon Duckett's book, *Javascript & JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development*

```
let hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  checkAvailability: function(){
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
  }
};
```
