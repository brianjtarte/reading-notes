#  Day 2 Reading Notes

## What we learned in Day 2

Today, we learned how to use the basic functions of the terminal, which is a **text based interface** to the system, allowing the user to navigate the computer, files, etc. In addtion to learning the basic functions, we learned how to set up our terminals with a third party text editor, which is software that allows the user to *write and manage text*. Because there are so many variations of text editors, we need to determine how to select the ***BEST*** editor for our needs.

## Choosing the right text editor for you - features it should have:

- code completion; a feature that predicts the command/code you're trying to use
- syntax highlighting; a feature that colorizes the code you type to make it easier to identify and look for errors
- variety of themes; allows the user to customize the interface (dark background and brightly colored text, for example)
- variety of available extensions; these are add-ons that make writing code more efficient for the user

It is important that you find what works best for you and your situation. There are plenty of great text editors to choose from, some free, and some paid.
