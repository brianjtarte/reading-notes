# Day 13 Notes

## Local Storage

- Local storage is accessed through the ```localStorage``` object.
- You should check that your browser supports it by using various functions, but an easy one to use is by Modernizer, which is free open source code distributed by MIT:

```
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```
### Using HTML5 Storage

- It is based on key/value pairs
- Store data based on a named key, and then you can retrieve the data with that key
- Data can be any type that is supported by JS
