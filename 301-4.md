# Day 4 - React and Forms

## Controlled Component

- An element whose value is controlled by a react component that not only renders a form but it also controls what happens with said form

## Updating the Form

- Generally speaking, we want to update state with responses as soon as they occur. The event handler will update with each keystroke, updating the state as they occur

## Targeting 

- Using the event.target.value method, we can specifically target what the user is inputting

## Ternary Operator

- We can use a ternary as a "replacement" for if/else statements to refactor/condense code
- Rewrite:
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```

```
(x===y)? console.log(true): console.log(false);
```
