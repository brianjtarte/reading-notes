## Django Best Practices

 - There are myriad recommendations on how to best setup and configure Django settings. We will cover a few:
   - One way is to create a `settings_local.py` and extend all environment specific settings in the standard `settings.py` file
     - In the `settings.py` you would import `settings_local.py` 
     - Inside of `settings.local.py` you would setup your local database for example
   - Another setup is create a separate settings file for each environment
     - The settings package should look like:
     - ```python
            settings/
                |-- __init__.py
                |-- base.py
                |-- ci.py
                |-- local.py
                |-- staging.py
                |-- production.py
                 -- qa.py

## SSH

- What is it?
  - SSH is 'Secure Shell Protocol' [that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet.](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)
  - To use SSH:
    - `ssh {user}@{host}`
      - Where `{user}` is the account you want to access and `{host}` is the computer you want to access. That can be an IP address or a domain name.
      - Upon hitting enter with that command you'll be prompted to enter a password for the requested account.
  - There are multiple encryption techniques: `Symmetrical`, `Asymmetrical`, and `Hashing`
