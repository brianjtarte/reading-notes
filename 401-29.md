# Reading 29 - Django Custom User

## Custom User Model

 - There are two ways to create a custom user model:
   - `AbstractUser` and `AbstractBaseUser`
   - Both allow subclassing to extend functionality, however, the latter requires more work.
 - There are **four** initial steps to begin creating a custom user model:
   - update `django_project/settings.py`
   - make a new `CustomUser` model
   - make a new `UserCreation` & `UserChangeForm`
   - Update admin
 - From there, we need to add the `accounts` app as well as utilize the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config. This will take the place of the native user model.

 - It is recommended to use a superuser for testing purposes:
   - the command to do so is `python manage.py createsuperuser`
 - You can always add additional [fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/customizing/)

## DjangoX
