## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

### Overview

 - Used to describe worst case efficiency an algorithm can have when doing its job
 - Evaluated on 2 factors:
   - Time: the amount of time it takes a function to complete
   - Space: the amount of memory resources a function uses

### Measuring Space and Time

There are four key areas we look at when analyzing space and time:
1. Input size
2. Units of measurement (UOM)
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best, Worst, and Average cases

### Input Size
 - Refers to the size of the parameter values in a given function that are read by the algorithm. It should be noted that this takes into account the size of each value in addition to considering the number of parameters
 - The higher the input number, the more likely we will see increased time and space

### UOM

- For time we use:
  - time in milliseconds, the number of executed operations, and the number of basic operations that are executed
- For memory we use:
  - amount of space required to hold the code
  - amount of space needed to hold input data
  - amount of space needed for output data
  - amount of space needed for working space during calculation


## Linked Lists

### What are they?
 - A sequence of nodes that are connected (linked) to each other. Each node references the next node in the link.
 - Two types: singly and doubly

#### Singly
- A singly list only contains one reference that points to the next node in the list
#### Doubly
- Two references within the node, pointing to the next AND the previous nodes
