# Day 5 Notes - Putting It All Together

## `single responsibility principle`

- It means the component should only do one thing; if it expands, it should ideally be broken up into subcomponents

## Build a Static Version of your App

- Simply put, build out all of your components and pass data using props, but avoid state. This is so you can see the UI, but not use any interactivity. This should facilitate modeling the data flow and help you understand how your UI is updated.

## Adding State

- After creating a static application, you'll need to add state to make your app interactive.

## Determining State

- There are 3 questions to ask to help determine state:
  - Is it passed in from a parent through props? If so, NO STATE!
  - Is it unchanged over time? If so, NO STATE!
  - Can it be computed based on other state or props in your component? If so, NO STATE!

## Finding a home for state

- Identify all components that render based on that particular state
- Find a common owner
  - Either common owner or a component higher up in the hierarchy should own state
- If you can't decide a sensible place to own state, create a new component for this and place it above the common component

## Higher-Order Functions

- Are functions that operate on other functions either by taking them in as arguemnts or by returning them.

- Line 2 will return a boolean testing whether m is greater than n

- `.map` transforms arrays through applying a function to the elements and returning a *new* array. `.reduce` can be used to summarize an array, or compute a single value from an array
