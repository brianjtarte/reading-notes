## Object Oriented Programming & HTML Tables

### Object Oriented Programming

- Store data in properties and behaviors in methods
- New keyword create an object
- Constructor function initializes properties inside that object using `this` variable
- Methods can get added to a constructor function's `prototype`, which allows two or more objects to share the same method, and consume less memory, which is ideal for phones/tablets
- Using constructor notation seems to be ideal for creating multiple objects
- The `this` keyword is used to refer to an object, and how it is used depends on where the function is declared

### HTML Tables

The `<table>` element is used to create tables, with the contents written by row

`<tr>` is used to indicate the start of each row and each cell is represented by the table data (`<td>`) tag.

`<th>` or table headings are used to give a heading to a row or column within a table

  - To assign the heading to a specific location (column or row), you can use the `scope` attribute followed by `col` or `row`
