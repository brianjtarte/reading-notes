# Reading 28 - Django Forms

## HTML Forms
 - As staed in the tutorial, "HTML forms are a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page" [Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms)
 - Forms are defined within the `<form>` `</form>` tags and they contain at least one type of `<input>` element with `type="submit"`
- The form attributes define the `method` to be used when sendingn the data and where to send it `action`

## Django Forms
- The `Form`class in Django specifies all the components of the form (layout, display, labels, etc.)
- Declaring for a `Form` is similar to `Model`
- There are many different arguments available in most fields on Django forms, including, but not limited to:
  - `required`
  - `label`
  - `initial`
  - `validators`
