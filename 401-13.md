# Day 13 - Linear Regression

## Linear Regression
- Is used for predictive analysis
- Examines whether a set of predictor variables are "good" at predicting the outcome AND which variables are [significant predictors](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/what-is-linear-regression/) of the outcome
- There are six types of linear regression:
  - Simple (1 dependent variable and one independent)
  - Multiple (1 dependent, 2 or more independent)
  - Logistic 1 dependent and 2 or more independent
  - Ordinal (1 dependent, 1+ independent (nominal or dichotomous))
  - Multinominal (1 dependent and 1 or more(interval or ratio or dichotomous)
  - Discriminant (1 dependent and 1+  independent)

## Train/Test
- In order to test the linear regression model we split it into a train and test set so we can accurately test the model's predicition
