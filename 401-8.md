# Reading 8 - List Comprehensions

## List Comprehensions
- Are a way to condense code to save time and improve productivity
- Can be used in place of for loops to achieve same result with less lines of code

## Utilizing List Comprehension

1. First, the expression you wish to carry out - in square brackets
2. Next, the object to be worked on by the expression
3. Lastly, an iterable list of objects to build the new list from

### EXAMPLE using `range()` method to build list of numbers

```
list_of_numbers = [x for x in range(5)]

print(list_of_numbers)

```
**OUTPUT**

``` 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
