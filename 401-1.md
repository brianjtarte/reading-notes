# Pain vs Suffering

- I agree that this course will cause pain, but there is such an incredible reward at the end, especially for me. I've longed to find a career I am passionate about, and this course will provide the means to do so. The prospect of a 6-month long course feels incredibly daunting, especially considering it is double the length of the previous courses. That said, I am excited, nervous, and understand that what awaits me at the end will all make the journey worth it!

## Big O Notation

- This seems incredibly foreign to me; perhaps its the lack of sleep, but all I can glean from this reading is that it's used to describe the performance/complexity of an algorithm. 

  - Update: Re-Read it this AM and I'm still mildly confused, but it seems like we can use it to evaluate various data sets and how efficient they are.
