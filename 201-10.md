# Reading Notes Day 10

## Debugging

*A couple of the best ways to debug and/or find other errors in your code are to:*
- use the console
- use dev tools/built in functionality within your web browser

### Order of Execution
1. It is important to understand the order of execution within javascript. This can help to quickly identify the source of the problem

### Execution Contexts
 - Every JS statement is in one of three contexts:
    - Global
    1. Code in a script but not a function
    - Function
    2. Code run within a function
    - Eval
    3. Text executed in an internal function called eval

Remember, the JS processes one line of code at a time.
