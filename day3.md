# *Day 3 Reading Notes*

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to work on the same code. It also tracks changes to the file, allowing the user to view, apply, and remove changes if necessary. Ultimately it is a collaboration tool, allowing developers to work on code even if they're not in the same geographic location.
