# Reading 7 - Ten Thousand 2

## Global Statements
- Allow you to define a list of names that will be treated as global names
- To create a global statement, you assign it a `global` keyword
- Can be used inside any function or nested function and the names listed within the global statement will always be mapped accordingly
- Can be assigned/updated from within other functions, nested or otherwise

## Nonlocal Statements
- Similar to `global` however, they cannot be assigned or updated
- Can *only* be used inside an inner or nested function. Cannot be used in a module or local scope.

### `Things I want to know more about:`
- Still need to finish the whole reading, but I want to dive in and learn more about the built-ins discussed at the end of the reading
