# Basic HTML/CSS/Javascript

## Refresher

We read about much of the same HTML, CSS, and JS that we learned in the latter half of 102. 

### *HTML*

 - Conducted a review of text markup with HTML
 - Reviewed HTML elements, which are, "used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs)." - Duckett, *HTML & CSS: Design aand Build Websites*, 2011

 - Some examples of HTML elements, which are contained within the left and right angle brackets:

 `<h1>Main Heading</h1>` 
 <h1>Main Heading</h1>

 `<p>Paragraph</p>` 
 <p>Doggo ipsum you are doing me a frighten shoob fat boi puggo the neighborhood pupper, shoober many pats wrinkler such treat, pupperino fluffer h*ck. Adorable doggo long woofer most angery pupper I have ever seen thicc many pats, heckin good boys ruff pats extremely cuuuuuute shibe, you are doing me a frighten maximum borkdrive borkdrive. Porgo most angery pupper I have ever seen such treat long woofer you are doing me a frighten doge, noodle horse maximum borkdrive length boy.</p>

 `<hr>Horizontal Break`
 <hr>
 
### CSS

 CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets are used to style HTML markup. They are how we make websites aesthetically pleasing. Some refreshers:

  - You can use internal/inline `<style></style>` tags to style your markup, or preferably create a .css sheet to `<link rel="stylesheet" href="gooddoggos.css/>`
  - The `rel` is the *relationship* between the HTML page and the file you are linking to. In this case, "stylesheet" is the appropriate value.
  - The `href` specifies the path for the HTML page to follow within the `link` tag to ensure it finds and uses the correct file.

  - You can target the entire HTML page to make changes, by using the `*{Univeral Selector}` ***OR*** you can target specific elements such as changing the style on all `h1 {}` elements. There are also other ways to target parts of your HTML, such as `.someclass` class selectors, which can be applied to multiple elements in the HTML or `#someid` id selectors, which are used for a specific element. An example might be if you have an attribute for all `<p>` tags, but for one particular paragraph, you want to style it differently. In this case, you would create an id tag and apply it to that particular paragraph.

### Javascript

  Javascript, a syntax language, is much like a recipe insofar that it contains very specific instructions (script) to be carried out.

  A few reminders:

  - Steps in your recipe are known as ***statements***
  - Javascript is case sensitive, so be mindful of how you write your statements
  - It is always good practice to use a `// Comment` to tell us what your code is/is doing.
  - Between the curly braces is known as your `{code block}`
  - In Javascript, you have
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Strings (text)
    - Boolean values (true or false)
