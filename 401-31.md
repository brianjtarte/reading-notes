# Reading Class 31 - Django Rest Framework/Docker

## What is Docker?
 - Docker is essentially a way to run `Linux` containers, a type of virtualization
 - It differs from a `Python` virtual environment because it can do more than just isolate Python packages locally, which is all a `.venv` can do
 - Two key fundamental concepts in Docker are: `images` and `containers`
   - `image`:
     - is a snapshot in time of what the project contains
     - created using `Dockerfile`
   - `container`:
     - runs an instance of the image
     - `docker-compose.yml` runs the container

## Django REST Framework
- Must be added *after* Django is properly configured
- Allows our Django app to act as an `API` endpoint
- Adding the `API` endpoint is the same as configuring traditional URLs
- Much like Django generic template views, Django REST Framework has generic views, as well. Example: `ListAPIView`
- These generic views present the information in JSON format instead of web format
