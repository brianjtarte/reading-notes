# Authentication

## What is OAuth?

What is OAuth?

- It is an authorization protocol that allows multiple websites to share user assets. Think SSO.

Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

 - Using OAuth might look like signing up for an account with a digital newspaper, and you're given the open to sign in with your credentials from Google or Apple.

How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

- It connects website A to website B on behalf of the user. Website B generates a token/secret and provides that to website A, which then gives this token/secret to the client software. 

What is OpenID?

- A system not dissimilar to OAuth at a very basic level, but is meant for authentication whereas OAuth is meant for authorization.

## Authentication and Authorization Code Flows

1.What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
- Authorization is obtaining permission and authentication is verifying.

2.What is Authorization Code Flow?
- User clicks login link
- authorization request occurs by web app sending to Auth0
- redirection to login/authorization from Auth0 back to user
- authenticate and gain consent from user and send back to Auth0
- Authorization code sent from Auth0 to webapp
- Code + client assets sent to 0Auth
- Validation occurs 
- Auth0 sends an ID/Access token back to web app
- Web app makes API call with user assets and token
- Response occurs

3.What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
 - Its the same as the above, however, after the login is clicked a code verifier and code challenge is presented.

4.What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
- Login clicked, then App sends credential req/res to Auth0, which redirects back to login prompt. Authentication and consent is sent from user to Auth0, which then provides token.

5.What is Client Credentials Flow?
- M2M app authenticates with client ID/Secret and send to Auth0 where it is validated and a token is returned.
- Request for data occurs with newly obtained token and response received.

6.What is Device Authorization Flow?
- User starts app on Device
- Device request authorization from Auth0 with Client ID
- Auth0 sends response with device code, user code, verification uri
- Device asks user to activate 
- Device poll for access token
- Auth0 determines if user has authorized device

7.What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
- Click login (user)
- Web app authenticates with username/pw and sends to Auth0
- Autho0 validates and provides access token
- Request with user credentials and token sent, response received
