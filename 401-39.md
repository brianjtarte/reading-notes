## Creating a Next.js App

**Why Next.js?**
- Next.js has myriad features, including, but not limited to:
  - Auto-code splitting, resulting in faster page loads
  - Built-in CSS and Sass support. Can also support all CSS-in-JS libraries
  - API routes

** Building the App **
- `npx create-next-app "title of your app"`
- `npm run dev` to start your development server

- These two steps will get you setup such that you'll be able to see a generic landing page with links to various resources for Next.js
- Creating additional pages for your app is as easy as creating a new directory under the 'pages' directory that is native to the app and building a new `.js` file
