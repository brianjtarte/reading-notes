# Reading Day 8

1. What does REST stand for?

- *Representational State Transfer*

2. REST APIs are designed around a *resource* that includes any object, data, or service that the client can access.

3. What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

- *An identifier is a URI, or a Uniform Resource Identifier, which uniquely identifes a particular resource*
**EXAMPLE**:
```
https://brians-breadworks.com/order/2
```

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?

- The most common HTTP verbs are *GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, & DELETE*

5. What should the URIs be based on?

- Ideally, a resource URI should be based on nouns, not verbs. That is, they should be based on *the* resource and not the *operation* on the resource.

6. Give an example of a good URI.

```
https://brians-breadworks.com/orders

```
7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

- If a web API is 'chatty' it exposes a large number of small resources that will impose a load on the web server. As a result, these types of APIs may require that a client app send multiple requests to obtain all the data it needs
