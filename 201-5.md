# Reading Notes Day 5

## *Images, Color, Text*

### Images

- According to Jon Duckett in his book, *HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites*, images on your web page should be:
  - Relevant
  - Convey information
  - Convey the right mood
  - Be instantly recognisable
  - Fit the color palette

Inserting an image in HTML is done by using the `<img>` element. Within the element should be a `src` that indicates where the HTML is going to pull the image from, most typically done in a child folder titled "images."

Finally, it is good practice to use the `alt` attribute, which provides a text description of the image if you can't see it.

Bonus: you can use the `title` attribute to provide additional information about the image that will pop up when you hover over it.

Duckett also states three rules for creating images:

1. Save images in the right format
    - Websites typically use .jpeg, .gif, or .png formats.
2. Save images at the right size
    - It is good practice to save the image at the size which it will appear on the webpage.
3. Use the correct resolution
    - The vast majority of computer screens only display images at 72 pixels per inch, so saving images at higher resolution is generally not recommended. A good practice is to select 100 pixels per inch when saving an image.

When do you use the different formats?

JPEG should be used when presenting the vast majority of images.

GIF should only be used if the image is animated.

PNG should only be selected if you need a transparent background for your image.

### Colors

CSS allows you to specify colors in 3 ways, and I will show examples using the color property:
  - RGB values
      - `color: rgb(100,100,90);`
  - Hex codes
      - `color: #ee3e80;`
  - Color names
      - `color: DarkCyan;`

If you're like me, you basically know the colors of the rainbow and that's where you knowledge of color ends.

There are near limitless color codes you can use to get the perfect color. My favorite place to go is: [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) where you can use a color wheel to select the perfect color AND color harmony, which is important when designing a web page.

### Text

There are myriad ways to decorate and style text in CSS, so I will discuss a few.

First, the two most popular styles of fonts are serif and sans-serif:

- Serif fonts have an extra stroke at the end of the primary stroke on a letter. An example of a serif font would be the traditional 'Times New Roman.'
- Sans-serif fonts are the direct opposite of serif. No extra strokes. A popular example of this is the 'Helvetica' font that Apple made popular (but ultimately dumped as their font of choice!).

You can adjust the weight (light, medium, etc.), style (normal, italic, etc.), and even stretch (regular, extended, etc.) font if you wish.

And of course, you can also adjust the size of your fonts through CSS.

Because decorating fonts has such an array of opportunities, I suggest visiting: [W3 Schools - CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp) to learn more about how you can improve the style of your web page!
