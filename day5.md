## ***Cascading Style Sheets***

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) are a way to *style* your web page...beautify it if you will.

They take your boring, uninspiring, HTML and turn it into something more aesthetically pleasing to the end user.

### How to add CSS

#### 3 Ways:
1. External (**PREFERRED**)
- Done by creating a .css page and linking to your html file via the link tag
2. Interal (ACCEPTABLE)
 - Done by using the style tag within the head of your HTML document
3. Inline (***NOPE***)
- Done by using the style tag directly inline with each individual piece of code you wish to style...also not recommended
