# Day 12 CRUD

1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = *informational status codes*

200’s = *success status codes*

300’s = *redirection status codes that tell the client the resource they want isn't at the same location anymore*

400’s = *client error codes, such as bad requests*

500’s = *server side error codes*

2. What is a status code 202?
- It means 'accepted' and is typical with asynchronous code

3. What is a status code 308?
- It's a permanent redirect telling the client to use the new path

4. What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
 - 404 Not Found to indicate a potential client request error, though it could still be a backend issue.

5. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
- 308

6. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
- 403 : the client doesn't have permissions to access

## MongoDB

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

- Because if it is in our server, it can be accessed by bad actors and compromise our database.

2. What is middleware?
 - It is code that runs when the server gets the request but before it is passed to the routes.

3. What does app.use(express.json()) do?
- It allows our server to use JSON as a body

4. What does the /:id mean in a route?
- Gives us the path to the unique id of a given object/value.

5. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- *PUT* uses the entire object/entity to make updates to a a URI by replacing everything that the PUT is called on whereas *PATCH* can make updates to individual entities within the object.

6. How do you make a default value in a schema?
- You create objects and provide a type, define if is required, and can set a default value. 

7. What does a 500 error status code mean?
- Internal server error
8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
- 200 is a general "OK" status code whereas 201 is used for create situations.
