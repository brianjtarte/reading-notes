# About Me

My name is Brian, and I'm here in an effort to change my career path to something I will find more rewarding and challenging. I have spent the last decade in Supply Chain Operations, with a deep understanidng of e-commerce, and prior to that, I'd served 5 years in Marine Corps aviation.

##### We have 3 dogs, and their names are:
1. Chomper (American Bulldog/Pitbull mix). He's a gentle giant and easily the laziest dog I have ever met.
2. Missy (Pitbull/Something high energy/super fast mix). We rescued her, and she must be near a human heartbeat at all times. She's also missing quite a few brain cells.
3. Molly (Pomapoo). A tiny terror who runs the household.

## What is this?

This page is where you can find notes from my daily readings.

## Growth Mindset

To me, the "Growth Mindset" is about acknowledging your natural skills and abilities, recognizing that they don't define you, rather they are the foundation that you will build off of. It is understanding that you **CAN** achieve just about anything if you approach it with the proper frame of mind. It is understanding your current limitations and what resources you can leverage to flip them on their head. It is understanding that you only fail if you stop trying; if instead you look at your failures as teachable moments and apply what you've learned, you can find success in every facet of life.

### ***Staying*** in the Growth Mindset
- Commit to effort. When effort ceases to exist, you cannot maintain a growth mindset.
- Reset to get unstuck. Instead of pushing problems aside to be dealt with later, take a step back, practice mindfulness, and reapproach the problem after I have cleared my headspace.
- Ask myself, "What made me smile today?" and then once I've answered that question, "What would you have done differently today?"
