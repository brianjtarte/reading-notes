# Reading Notes Day 8

## CSS Layout

- There are a few key concepts when positioning elements:
  - HTML looks at elements in two ways:
    - They are in `inline box` or a `block-level box`

- Block-level elements:
   - `<h1>`,`<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- Inline elements:
  - `<img>`, `<b>`, `<i>`

## Controlling the position of the elements

- Normal Flow: Paragraphs appear one after another
- Relative Positioning: moves from its normal position to the top, right, bottom, or left
- Absolute: Heading is positioned to the rop right, paragraphs sit at top of screen
- Fixed Positioning: Heading is placed at center of page and 25% from the top, while the rest appears in normal flow
- Floating Elements: Floating allows paragraph to flow around it
