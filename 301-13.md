# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

 - At the same time we saw the decline, we saw in increase in personal computers in homes. The caveat is that these computers were heavily marketed towards males with various games...it drove the narrative that computers are for boys.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- Because they were way ahead of the curve when it came to knowledge/experience with computers. Families were more likely to buy computers for males than females because of the narrative being driven at the time, even when females expressed interest.

## Employee Breakdown of Key Technology Companies

1. Tech is still heavily dominated by white males. There are a few companies whose ratio more closely aligns with the US population breakdown, but we still have a ways to go.

2. POCs are largely underrepresented in tech companies

3. The two most popular computer/software companies aren't doing a great job with gender diversity.
