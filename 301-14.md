1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

- To update a record through an API, you'd use the HTTP method ***PUT***, which allows you replace all the data of the targeted resource though identifying it's unique ```id```

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

- Both ***PUT*** and ***DELETE*** require an ```id``` parameter so you can isolate a targeted resource versus the entire entity.



A. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

  - REST is a design style for API applications whereas CRUD is literally just the acronym for what we can do with API databases. REST can do everything CRUD outlines, and seems to have a little more flexibility with what it can do.


B. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
 
 i. Create your express app

 ii. Create your router to identify your routes

 iii. Give your server the ability to CRUD by assigning the appropriate methods

 iv. Identify your resources

 v. Determine resource representation (i.e. use JSON object)
